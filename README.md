# awesome-men
Listing men who are awesome to provide acknowledgement of them and hope for people who don't have any awesome men around them.

To be clear, awesome in this case is defined by speaking up against sexism, racism, heterosexism, and/or other -isms. Sometimes that's as simple as a code of conduct but most of the time it means calling in or calling out people who take *-ist actions.

Men are listed in order discovered.
